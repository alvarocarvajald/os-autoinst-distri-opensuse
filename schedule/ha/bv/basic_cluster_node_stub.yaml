  Based on schedule/ha/bv/basic_cluster_node.yaml. Please look at that file for more information.

  Cluster Test. Schedule for alpha/beta/ctdb (2 nodes cluster) and delta/gamma (3 nodes cluster).

  Some settings are required in the job group or test suite for this schedule to work.

  The other settings required in the job group are.

  CLUSTER_NAME must be defined for all jobs as a string.
  HA_CLUSTER_INIT must be defined to yes in the job that initializes the cluster, and to no
  in the remaining cluster node jobs
  HA_CLUSTER_JOIN must be defined for the rest of the jobs, and it must contain the
  hostname of the job where HA_CLUSTER_INIT is defined to yes
  HOSTNAME must be defined to different hostnames for each node.
  All jobs with the exception of the parent job must include a PARALLEL_WITH setting
  referencing the parent job.
  NICTYPE and WORKER_CLASS must be set to 'tap' in the job group directly in qemu based jobs.
  TWO_NODES must be set to 'no' for every cluster with more than '2' nodes.
  And of course, YAML_SCHEDULE must point to this file.

  Below are the optional settings.

  CTDB_TEST_ROLE can be defined as 'server' for testing CTDB.
  HA_CLUSTER_DRBD can be defined for enabling DRBD test.
  HA_REMOVE_NODE can be defined for testing a node removal.
  USE_DISKLESS_SBD can be defined for making a cluster without sbd device.
  USE_SYSRQ_FENCING can be defined for fencing through sysrq instead of 'crm node fence' command.
